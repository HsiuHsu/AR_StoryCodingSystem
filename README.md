# AR Story Coding System
## Introduction

AR Story Coding System is a virtual-real interactive system. The purpose of this project is to provide social learning for children in ASD.

## Tech Stack

Develop with Unity and use AR Foundation technology for virtual-real interaction design. Output to Apk (APP) for operating on tablets.

Unity, AR Vuforia, AR Foundation

## Tool Stack

### 3D Models & Character Animation

iClone, Character Creator

### Design Tools

Adobe Illustrator

## System Structure
 
In this system, there are two different ways to play: 

1. Board Game
2. Simulated Interaction

## Practical Operation
**Board Game**

By scanning the graphic social situation cards with the camera, the virtual social situations will be presented on the digital screen, allowing learners to learn more about social behavior.

**Simulated Interaction**

Detect the plane in the actual field through the illumination of the lens. Using tracking technology, the virtual stereo image is presented in the actual field to achieve the effect of overlapping the virtual and actual fields. It allows participants to learn social behavioral actions through simulation.
